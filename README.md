# Purpose of the project
<p>The main goal of the project is to reveal the abundant and colorful history of the peoples inhabiting the lands of today's Bulgaria, as well as to visually show the way of life of the then population. The park-museum will include the peoples inhabiting the Bulgarian lands over the centuries: from the Neolithic through the First Bulgarian Kingdom to now. The large-scale project will present a kind of journey back in time, through the most famous buildings of the respective period, restaurants for traditional food, with attractive historical films and an abundance of artefacts. There will also be a variety of crafts on display for people to try out. The complex will be divided into several settlements separated in different periods.</p>
